I have over 15 years of experience as a passionate software engineer. My specialty is finding optimal and comprehensive solutions while keeping long-term effects in mind and applying design principles such as KISS, TDD, and Agile. I am highly motivated to stay up-to-date with new technologies and methodologies, and am driven to meet challenges and create useful frameworks.
